# NS_NLP_prolog

A natural selection simulation type program for prolog. Users query the program with different input settings (Landscape, animal types, probability, days to simulate, pooulation, etc) and a result will be produced that will describe the end result of the simulation.

# Project Tasks
- Base specification implemented (Different enviornment or different animals each with unique properties, food availability that changes rate of birth or death, etc)
- Simulation formula and functions (Able to simulate N days given the georaphy, animals, popluation, probabilities etc)
- Iteraction between animals/environment

# Bug backlog

# Extra
- Add Natural language processing so the user can query information about the model/environment and run the simulation in plain english.

# Development Notes
- When writing the code try to add a comment on what the code is doing
- When pushing up the code into main branch, write the code in a separate branch and create a pull request instead (For possible code review before merge)

# TODO
- ~~Finish main NS algorithm to take a list of initial environments, a number of days, and return the final list of environments~~
- ~~Update the interaction function~~
- ~~Look into setting up NLP queries to run the NS simulation~~
